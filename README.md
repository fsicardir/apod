# APOD
## Astronomy Picture Of the Day
This project provides a front end for [APOD, one of NASA's open APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/).
This is a simple API that returns a space related image for each day of the year, along with an interesting explanation written by a professional astronomer. 

It already counts with a very neat and simple [official front end](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html), but creating another one from scratch seemed like an interesting experiment and a great opportunity to practice React and learn TypeScript.

### Current state
Very basic view of the current image and description.
The website is hosted by GitHub and you can see it [here](https://apod.cf).

### Improvements and new features planned
- Better design and UX.
- Nicer logo and favicon.
- Position loader correctly.
- Search for images of another day.
- Image gallery for recent photos.
- Research for a better way to load images.
