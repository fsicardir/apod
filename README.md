# APOD
## Astronomy Picture Of the Day
This project provides a front end for [APOD, one of NASA's open APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/).
This is a simple API that returns a space related image for each day of the year, along with an interesting description written by a professional astronomer. 

It already counts with a very neat and simple [official front end](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html), but creating another one from scratch seemed like an interesting experiment and a great opportunity to practice React and learn TypeScript.
